            Born and raised in the Dominican Repubic, moved to the US in 2015.
            I'm a junior computer science student with minors in Psychology and
            Mathematics at Queens College. I enjoy learning new things, thinking
            critically about things and solving problems. I'm also an avid
            reader, and in my free time I explore topics from my personal wide
            range of interests. I'm currently exploring fields in software
            development to hopefully find my place and contribute to society
            using the skills I've acquired along the way.

      Intro to tables:
        Tables help structure data. By default, when you create a table,
        the table has no borders (it can be added using css). There are attributes that were once
        useful for tables, but now are deprecated.
        <table> 
          <tr> -Creates a table row.
            <td> - creates a table cell for that row.
          </tr>
        </table>
        If we want our table to have headers then we should use the following structure
        <table> 
          <thead>
            <th> Creates a table header cell
          </thead>
